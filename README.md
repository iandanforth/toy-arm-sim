# toy-arm-sim
A toy Brachialis / Tricep simulation for deep reinforcement learning

## Getting Started

Install pipenv. (A modern way to combine pip and virtual environments for cleaner package management.)

```
pip install pipenv
```

This may require being run with 'sudo' depending on how your system is set up.

Install dependencies and start a clean python environment

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

Run the sim

```
python main.py
```


To exit the sim hit `esc` or close the window.

To exit this python environment 

```
pipenv exit
```

or close your terminal and start a new one.
