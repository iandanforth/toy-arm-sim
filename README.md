## Getting Started

Install pipenv. (A modern way to combine pip and virtual environments for cleaner package management.)

```
pip install pipenv
```

If this throws a permissions error you will need to to run this with 'sudo'

```
sudo pip install pipenv
```

Install dependencies and start a clean python environment

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

Run the sim

```
python main.py
```


To exit the sim hit `esc` or close the window.

To exit this python environment

```
exit
```

or close your terminal and start a new one.
